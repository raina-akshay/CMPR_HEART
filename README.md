# [Comparative Analysis of various Research proposals at the task of Heart Disease Prediction](https://akshayraina.in/projects/Heart-Disease-Prediction/ "Project Webpage")
### IN DEV!
This is a Python- based implementation of various (at least 10) Research Studies/ Articles/ proposals already published on the task of heart disease prediction using Machine Learning and accomplishment the same results.

## Details of the Papers/ Articles Implemented:
1. **Heart Disease Prediction using Multilayer Perceptron Algorithm**
    * *Cite at*: Kirmani MM. Heart disease prediction using multilayer perceptron algorithm. International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer Science. 2017 May 15;8(5)
    * *Methodology*: MM Kirmani used the Multilayer Perceptron Model with hidden layers and back- propagation to classify an instance into *diseased* or *fit*. He also used the 10- fold cross validation with an intention to overcome imbalance of fitting.
    * *Dataset Used*: [Cleveland](/datasets/cleveland.csv) from the [UCI ML Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease).
2. **HDPM: An Effective Heart Disease Prediction Model for a Clinical Decision Support System**
    * *Cite at*: Fitriyani NL, Syafrudin M, Alfian G, Rhee J. HDPM: An Effective Heart Disease Prediction Model for a Clinical Decision Support System. IEEE Access. 2020 Jul 20;8:133034-50.
